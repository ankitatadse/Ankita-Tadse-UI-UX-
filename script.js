    role: 'UX + UI Designer', timeline: '4 Weeks', platform: 'Web (SaaS)',
    overview: 'A SaaS product\'s file upload flow was causing silent failures — users were uploading files, getting no clear confirmation, and walking away thinking it worked. The redesign focused entirely on making system status visible at every stage.',
    problem: 'Three core problems: (1) No visible progress during upload — users couldn\'t tell if anything was happening. (2) Error messages were cryptic strings like "Error 415" with no guidance on how to fix them. (3) The success state looked identical to the idle state, so users uploaded the same file twice regularly.',

    role: 'UI/UX Designer', timeline: '8 Weeks', platform: 'iOS',
    overview: 'Existing language apps felt like homework — long sessions, passive learning, and no real motivation loop. This concept rethinks English learning as a series of short, high-engagement micro-sessions built around habit science: keep it under 10 minutes, reward consistency, and make speaking less scary.',
